<br>
<p>You can create your own account on this site.</p>
<p>The site provides some features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add books, you have read</li>
  <li>Add books you want to read</li>
  <li>Filter books by authors, categories, and years of reading</li>
  <li>Give a subjective assessment of the book from 1 to 10</li>
  <li>Write your review about the book</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you can track your reading progress from year to year</p>
<p>Command to install the necessary dependencies:<br>
  <b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b></p>
<p>You can run the server locally and execute the command in the terminal:<br>
